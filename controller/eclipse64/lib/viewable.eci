These are logical, multidimensional\n           arrays and graph structures whose elements can be accessed\n           globally for visualisation purposes. The creation,\n           destruction and modification of viewables and their\n           contents can be monitored by visualisation clients. </P>\n\n           <P> The library <CODE>lib(graph_algorithms)</CODE> contains\n           predicates to create and manipulate graph structures.\n\n           <P> Viewables are created using <CODE>viewable_create/2/3/4</CODE>\n            and last until this call is\n           backtracked over. During its lifetime, a viewable is said to be\n           <EM>existent</EM>. This can be tested with\n           <CODE>viewable/1</CODE>, which can also be used to enumerate all\n           existent viewables. </P>\n\n           <P> One or more of the dimensions of a viewable can\n           optionally be flexible in size while the viewable is\n           existent. This allows new elements to be added to the\n           viewable, using <CODE>viewable_expand/3/4</CODE>. The\n           <EM>fixity</EM> of a dimension denotes whether it is fixed\n           or flexible. In the case of graph typed viewables, the\n           fixity refers to the ability to add new nodes and/or edges\n           to the graph.  Currently only <EM>fixed</EM> graphs are\n           supported.\n\n           <P> A viewable is given a type when it is created. For\n           array types, this specifies the number of dimensions, the\n           fixity of each dimension and the type of viewable elements\n           which the viewable can contain. For graph types, this\n           simply specifies whether the graph structure (number of\n           nodes, edge direction etc) may be modified during the\n           viewables lifetime. An existent viewable's type can be\n           retrieved using <CODE>viewable_type/2</CODE>, and its\n           current sizes of the dimensions can be retrieved using\n           <CODE>viewable_size/2.</code> </P>\n\n           <h3>Optimised behaviour without visualisation</h3> Visualisation\n           clients can only monitor viewables whose creation occurs\n           <em>after</em> they register. When there are no registered\n           visualisation clients, for efficiency purposes no data on\n           viewables is stored and so the predicates in this module behave\n           slightly differently from normal:\n\n           <ul>\n\n           <li><code>viewable_create/2/3/4</code> and\n           <code>viewable_expand/3/4</code> succeed with any arguments. It is\n           therefore reasonable to leave these predicates in your code even\n           when not visualising.</li>\n\n           <li><code>viewable/1</code>, <code>viewable_size/2</code> and\n           <code>viewable_type/2</code> fail whatever the arguments. If\n           these predicates are used (normally they should not be\n           necessary) the possibility of failure should be taken into\n           account.</li>\n\n           </ul>\n\n")).

The dimension must have been declared\n      flexible when the viewable was first created. The\n      <em>ExtraElements</em> argument is of the same format as the\n      <em>Elements</em> argument of <code>viewable_create/3</code>.</p>\n\n      <p>The number and size of the dimensions of <em>ExtraElements</em>\n      depends on the number and size of dimensions of the viewable being\n      expanded. <em>ExtraElements</em> should have one less dimension than\n      the viewable -- dimension <em>DimensionNumber</em> should be\n      missing. The remaining dimensions should have the same sizes as the\n      corresponding dimensions in the viewable.</p>\n\n      <p>For example, a viewable of size 3 x 0 x 0 with all dimensions\n      flexible, can be expanded along dimenson 3 using an\n      <em>ExtraElements</em> argument of []([], [], []) which has size 3 x\n      0. The viewable would then have size 3 x 0 x 1. It could then be\n      expanded along dimension 1 using <code>[]</code> as\n      <em>ExtraElements</em> since <code>[]</code> can implicitly have the\n      size 0 x 1. The viewable would then have the size 4 x 0 x 1. Then\n      dimension 2 could be expanded using <code>[[W],[X],[Y],[Z]]</code>\n      for <em>ExtraElements</em> as this has size 4 x 1. The final size of\n      the viewable would then be 4 x 1 x 1.</p>\n\n      <p>The extra viewable elements must each also conform to the element\n      type specified when the viewable was created.</p>\n\n      <p> Note that when the viewable has one dimension, the\n      <em>ExtraElements</em> argument will simply become the new element\n      itself.</p>\n\n      <p><code>viewable_expand/3</code> sets the name of the new location \n      (e.g. the column or row name) to its number as a string. For example, \n      adding a third row using <code>viewable_expand/3</code> will result\n      in the row being named \"3\".
